<p>There are several ways to monitor the progress of the snapshot and restore processes while they are running. Both
operations support <code class="literal">wait_for_completion</code> parameter that would block client until the operation is completed. This is
the simplest method that can be used to get notified about operation completion.</p>
<p>The snapshot operation can be also monitored by periodic calls to the snapshot info:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1208.console"></div>
<p>Please note that snapshot info operation uses the same resources and thread pool as the snapshot operation. So,
executing a snapshot info operation while large shards are being snapshotted can cause the snapshot info operation to wait
for available resources before returning the result. On very large shards the wait time can be significant.</p>
<p>To get more immediate and complete information about snapshots the snapshot status command can be used instead:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_status</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1209.console"></div>
<p>While snapshot info method returns only basic information about the snapshot in progress, the snapshot status returns
complete breakdown of the current state for each shard participating in the snapshot.</p>
<p>The restore process piggybacks on the standard recovery mechanism of the Elasticsearch. As a result, standard recovery
monitoring services can be used to monitor the state of restore. When restore operation is executed the cluster
typically goes into <code class="literal">red</code> state. It happens because the restore operation starts with "recovering" primary shards of the
restored indices. During this operation the primary shards become unavailable which manifests itself in the <code class="literal">red</code> cluster
state. Once recovery of primary shards is completed Elasticsearch is switching to standard replication process that
creates the required number of replicas at this moment cluster switches to the <code class="literal">yellow</code> state. Once all required replicas
are created, the cluster switches to the <code class="literal">green</code> states.</p>
<p>The cluster health operation provides only a high level status of the restore process. It’s possible to get more
detailed insight into the current state of the recovery process by using <a class="xref" href="indices-recovery.html" title="Index recovery API">index recovery</a> and
<a class="xref" href="cat-recovery.html" title="cat recovery API">cat recovery</a> APIs.</p>

</h3>
<p>The snapshot and restore framework allows running only one snapshot or one restore operation at a time. If a currently
running snapshot was executed by mistake, or takes unusually long, it can be terminated using the snapshot delete operation.
The snapshot delete operation checks if the deleted snapshot is currently running and if it does, the delete operation stops
that snapshot before deleting the snapshot data from the repository.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">DELETE /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1210.console"></div>
<p>The restore operation uses the standard shard recovery mechanism. Therefore, any currently running restore operation can
be canceled by deleting indices that are being restored. Please note that data for all deleted indices will be removed
from the cluster as a result of this operation.</p>

<a id="_effect_of_cluster_blocks_on_snapshot_and_restore"></a>Effect of cluster blocks on snapshot and restore<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.7/docs/reference/snapshot-restore/monitor-snapshot-restore.asciidoc">edit</a>
</h3>
<p>Many snapshot and restore operations are affected by cluster and index blocks. For example, registering and unregistering
repositories require write global metadata access. The snapshot operation requires that all indices and their metadata as
well as the global metadata were readable. The restore operation requires the global metadata to be writable, however
the index level blocks are ignored during restore because indices are essentially recreated during restore.
Please note that a repository content is not part of the cluster and therefore cluster blocks don’t affect internal
repository operations such as listing or deleting snapshots from an already registered repository.</p>
